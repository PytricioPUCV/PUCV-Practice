# üìö Repository of University Tests and Practices

This repository contains various projects and examples that I have done as part of my university studies, as well as other personal experiments and tests that I do to improve my programming skills.

## üóÇÔ∏è Contents

The repository includes practices and code examples in the following programming languages:

- **C**: Contains low-level programs, including direct memory manipulations, basic algorithms, and other C programming examples.
- **Java**: Includes examples of structured projects, such as applications using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern.
- **Python**: Contains small projects focused on algorithms, and basic problem-solving.
- **JavaScript**: Examples and practices with a scripting language that I am exploring and using in individual projects.

## üèóÔ∏è Repository Structure

Each project or practice is organized in separate folders, labeled according to the programming language used. Within each folder, you will find source files, scripts, and possibly other resources needed to run or understand the project.
